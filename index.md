### MSFT stock returns forecasting


The goal of the project is to perform all steps/elements of the empirical analysis with financial/economic data, with the goal to produce useful forecasts. The project is organized in several phases and multiple steps within each phase.

The whole data analysis, visualization, statistical tests, forecasting and valuation done in [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/). [Project code](https://github.com/mcf-long-short) is organized across multiple directories, in [R Notebooks](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-10.html). One convenient thing with R notebooks is that you can generate various output formats, html including, which can be deployed to the [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/) from RStudio.

All the notebooks, used in the project, are organized according to the several phases for forecasting and  are deployed to the RPubs.


### Project phases:

Each of the project phases has detailed description of all the steps, implementation details, intuition for modeling, interpretation of data analysis, modeling, evaluation and statistical test that were performed.
